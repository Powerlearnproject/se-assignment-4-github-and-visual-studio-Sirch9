Assignment: GitHub and Visual Studio
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of GitHub and Visual Studio. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Introduction to GitHub:

What is GitHub, and what are its primary functions and features? Explain how it supports collaborative software development.
Repositories on GitHub:

* Github is an online plateform that allows colloboration amoung develpers.
  It's, main functions are 
      1) Git is used to tracking changes in the source code
      2) The distributed version control tool is used for source code management
      3) It allows multiple developers to work together
      4) It supports non-linear development through its thousands of parallel branches
  It's main features are 
      1) Tracks history
      2) Free and open source
      3) Supports non-linear development
      4) Creates backups
      5) Scalable
      6) Supports collaboration
      7) Branching is easier
      8) Distributed development

* users can clone repositories, make changes locally, commit those changes to their local repository, and 
  then push the changes to a central repository

What is a GitHub repository? Describe how to create a new repository and the essential elements that should be included in it.
Version Control with Git:

* A Git repository is the .git/ folder inside a project. This repository tracks all changes made to files in 
  your project, building a history over time.

      1) Create a new folder for your project.
      2) Open the folder in Git BASH.
      3) Issue the git init command to create the new Git repo.
      4) Note the creation of the hidden . git folder in the project.
      5) Add files and folders to your project.
      6) Routinely stage files and create commits.

Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?
Branching and Merging in GitHub:
* Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall
  specific versions later.
* track changes made to your code, collaborate with others, and maintain a clean and stable codebase. By 
  using Git and GitHub effectively, you can enhance your development workflow and deliver high-quality products.

What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.
Pull Requests and Code Reviews:
* Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each 
  repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches.
* Creating a branch in Git involves using the command `git checkout -b branch_name`, which both creates a new
  branch named `branch_name` and switches to it. Here, you can make changes to your code using your preferred editor or IDE. After making changes, you stage them with `git add .` and then commit them with `git commit -m "Commit message"` to save your work locally.

  Once changes are complete and tested, switch back to the main branch using `git checkout main`. To merge the changes from your branch into the main branch, use `git merge branch_name`. This integrates your branch's changes into the main branch.

  Finally, to share your changes with others or the remote repository, use `git push origin main` to push the updated main branch to the remote repository.

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
GitHub Actions:
  
* A pull request in GitHub is a proposed change to a repository that enables collaboration and code review among team members. 

     1. Creating a Pull Request (PR):
       - Fork a repository or create a branch from the main repository.
       - Make changes, commit them, and push to your branch.
       - Go to GitHub and navigate to your branch, then click "New pull request".
       - Compare changes, add a title, description, and reviewers, then submit the PR.

    2. Reviewing a Pull Request:
       - Team members receive a notification or can manually review the PR.
       - Reviewers can see the code diff, leave comments, and approve or request changes.
       - Discussions and feedback help refine the code.
       - Once approved, the changes can be merged into the main branch.


Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
Introduction to Visual Studio:

* GitHub Actions are automation tools provided by GitHub that enable developers to automate workflows directly within their repositories. These workflows are defined in YAML files and can be triggered by various events such as commits, pull requests, or scheduled times.

Usage and Automation:
GitHub Actions can automate tasks like continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), or any custom workflow. For instance, a CI/CD pipeline can be configured to automatically run tests on code changes and deploy applications to staging or production environments upon approval or merge to specific branches.
     
          name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
      
    - name: Build and deploy
      run: |
        npm run build
        # Example deployment step (replace with actual deployment commands)
        echo "Deploying to staging..."
        # Example deployment command: ssh and copy files to staging server
